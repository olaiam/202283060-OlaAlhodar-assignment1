# Assignment 1 – Foundation & AI Integration

This repository contains a responsive personal portfolio website developed for Assignment 1.  
The project demonstrates a structured, professional approach to front-end web development using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and AI-assisted tools.

The website is designed to be **clear, intuitive, and easy to navigate**, allowing users to understand the content and interact with the interface without any technical background.

---

## 📌 Project Description

The portfolio website consists of three main sections:

- **About Me** – a brief introduction and overview of skills  
- **Projects** – sample projects presented in a consistent, card-based layout with images  
- **Contact** – a simple contact form with front-end validation and user feedback  

The layout emphasizes readability, visual balance, and smooth interaction, while maintaining a clean and professional appearance.

## 🛠 Technologies Used

- **HTML5** – semantic structure and content organization  
- **CSS3** – modern styling, transitions, animations, and responsive layout using Flexbox and Grid  
- **JavaScript (Vanilla)** – user interaction, UI behavior, and form validation  
- **Git & GitHub** – version control and repository management  

---

## ✨ Features

- Fully responsive design for desktop, tablet, and mobile screens  
- Dark and light theme toggle for improved user experience  
- Smooth hover effects and transitions  
- Section reveal animations on scroll  
- Scroll progress indicator

## 📄 Technical Documentation

Detailed technical explanations are provided in the `docs` folder:

- **technical-documentation.md** – explains file roles, layout decisions, responsive design strategy, and JavaScript functionality  
- **ai-usage-report.md** – documents how AI tools were used during development and how the output was reviewed and adapted  

These documents ensure transparency and clarity regarding the technical implementation of the project.

## 🤖 AI-Assisted Development

AI tools were used to support development by:
- Assisting with layout and styling ideas
- Helping implement interactive JavaScript features
- Improving code readability and structure
- Supporting documentation writing

All AI-generated suggestions were reviewed, understood, and manually refined before final integration.

## 📝 Notes

This project is a front-end–only implementation.  
The contact form demonstrates client-side validation and user feedback without server-side processing.
